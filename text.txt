Solar energy is simply incredible. It has one of the lowest
carbon footprints of any energy source, is by far the cheapest
energy we have ever had, and, unsurprisingly, is the most
popular renewable energy. However, it also has a horrific and
mostly unheard-of dark side that has the potential to decimate
vast ecosystems. For years, this shady aspect of solar power
has threatened to derail the solar movement, but a recent
breakthrough may have just resolved this sorry situation. So,
has solar energy been saved from itself?
